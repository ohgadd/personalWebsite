      <p>This was the course selected before arriving at university. This was quite a different experience for myself as I had not investigated this area of computing personally, but when talked about by staff at alternative universities during open
        days, it sounded a great option. After almost a year, I personally wasn't enjoying the specific area of computing, however, as I was already so deep into the course at University and funds were limited, this course had to be finished. There
        was a positive to this course being that there were optional units to be done. These allowed me to study areas more interesting to myself, including Data Mining.</p>

      <p>This year of computing was very much presented as a 'taster' year, consisting of many units. This allowed for a wide range of areas to be studied allowing for a broader option in the future and to give the opportunity to students to change
        course if they felt necessary. This however was not true for me, as none of the topics presented in later years were even looked at during this time.</p>

            Working in the retail side of the gambling industry really gave an insight on how the companies are run, but that argument is for another time. This specific job and the similar roles listed below consisted of working behind the counter
            in
            the stores to deal with customers and provide good service when required. The job overall was quite enjoyable as it was never predictable what a day could be like. However, there would often be incidents in stores where a customer loses
            their
            temper and causes a scene. It would be our duty to often solve these issues with patience or correct decision making, such as calling authorities if necessary. As a manager, I was also responsible for checking and filling out cash flow
            sheets
            for the day/week in addition to flagging up any concerns about anything that happened each day. While at Betfred, there was a low number of employees for the area in which I worked. I took it upon myself to cover any free shifts in the
            area
            with overtime, which consisted of travelling for sometimes an hour to cover a shift with short notice.

            This required good time management as it was important to fit this in around my studies suitably. It was required to plan a route before departing to ensure that the journey was time efficient. After the stores had been visited, a report
