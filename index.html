      <p id="aboutText" class="text-center">Hi, I'm Josh Gadd and my passion lies within front-end web development.
        <br><br>I first began web development during my college course, where I learned about basic HTML4 and CSS. This included things such as the box model and basic styling. It was not until a while later that I realised this is what I wanted to do. During my university course, which was based on Computer Forensics and Security, the first year held a unit based on User Centered Web Development which is where I started to notice I was actually enjoying completing assignments. Later on, in second year I took an optional unit based on Web Technology Integration, in which we learned about Content Management Systems and this is where I really found out what I wanted to pursue, which was front-end web development.

      <h5>Work Experience @ CR-eative Design</h5>
      <h6 class="text-right">March 2017 - 1 Month</h6>
      <p>CR-eative Design is a digital design company, located in Cardiff. While I was on work experience here, I was focused on trying to learn about the business and how it operates. Also, while I was here, the idea of this website started and I began development and also started trying to learn additional languages to further my skills in web development. While I was here, I was also assigned some small tasks to complete in Photoshop and inDesign which I enjoyed completing in return for having me on work experience.<br>

      <h5>Cashier at Coral Betting</h5>
      <h6 class="text-right">October 2016 - June 2017</h6>
      <p>Working at Coral was my first hourly rate job. It was good to finally get a job after applying for around a month and it was great for earning money alongside my studies at university. Being a cashier, my role was to take bet slips from customers, scan them through the till with the correct price, and return the printed slip. After the slips are scanned, they are to be translated to the desired events and selections. At some points of the job, it could become stressful due to a rush of customers trying to get their bets on, and it could sometimes cause some aggressive behaviour to start. It was our duty to calm the situations when they rose and deal with it acceptably. Overall, the job was quite enjoyable but left due to going back home for a placement year in the 3rd year of my studies.<br>

      <h5>Auditor for Serve Legal</h5>
      <h6 class="text-right">October 2015 - October 2016</h6>
      <p>The purpose of Serve Legal is to test Think 21/25 policies by purchasing age-restricted products from stores. During working as an auditor, I would be given a list of stores to visit before a certain date and to fill out a report on the given stores, whether this just be about the age policies or a store review also. During this job, I had to first plan the order in which I would travel to the group of stores I had been given and when I would have time to do them. After completing visits, I would have to complete detailed reports that would describe the store and staff inside.<br>
