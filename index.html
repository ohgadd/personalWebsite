      </div>
      <p>CR Design, an award-winning design agency, that has worked with over 250 professional outfits since founded in 2008. This experience consisted of learning about the business itself, how it functions and the work behind the scenes. It was during this, that the idea of a ‘personal website’ came to mind, which can be found with my contact details. While I was at the organisation, I was assigned small tasks to complete, which required knowledge of the Adobe Products; Photoshop and InDesign, that I was more than capable of completing.<br>

        <div class="right"><h6>January 2018 - August 2018</h6></div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Working in the retail side of the gambling industry really gave an insight on how the companies are run, but that argument is for another time. This specific job and the similar roles listed below consisted of working behind the counter in the stores to deal with customers and provide good service when required. The job overall was quite enjoyable as it was never predictable what a day could be like. However, there would often be incidents in stores where a customer loses their temper and causes a scene. It would be our duty to often solve these issues with patience or correct decision making, such as calling authorities if necessary. As a manager, I was also responsible for checking and filling out cash flow sheets for the day/week in addition to flagging up any concerns about anything that happened each day. While at Betfred, there was a low number of employees for the area in which I worked. I took it upon myself to cover any free shifts in the area with overtime, which consisted of travelling for sometimes an hour to cover a shift with short notice. <br></p>

        <div class="right"><h6>October 2015 - October 2016</h6></div>
      </div>
      <p>This role consisted of purchasing age-restricted products from stores to ensure they are following their Think 21/25 policies. As an auditor, a list of stores would be given every so often that had to be visited before the listed deadlines. This required good time management as it was important to fit this in around my studies suitably. It was required to plan a route before departing to ensure that the journey was time efficient. After the stores had been visited, a report would need to be completed that would describe the customer journey.</h6></p>
